    "_During pandemic (like the current Covid-19 pandemic), the medical system gets overwhelmed by the patient influx. Since hospitals are heavily understaffed to deal with such a crisis, any automation would alleviate the system of the stress._\n",

    "_1. Analytical Approach - \n",
    "Since we are predominantly looking for people with a respiratory illness, we can use a decision tree to segregate patients based on their symptoms. For the decision tree to work, we need to decide which parameters to use which will ensure node purity and maximum information gain. Patient symptoms, travel history, and contact with any infected person can be used to classify patients._\n",
    "\n",
    "_2. Data Requirements - \n",
    "Since we determined that patient symptoms, travel history to any disease hotspot country, and any contact with a known case, a data collection of all patients reporting to hospital with those cases is needed._\n",
    "\n",
    "_3. Data Collection -\n",
    "The main sources of data collection would be the hospital databases (structured data), emergency phone call records (to hospitals, individual medical practitioners and helplines - this may be unstructured and semi-structured data), airport data to name a few sources._\n",
    "\n",
    "_4. Data Understanding and Preparation -\n",
    "According to WHO, symptoms for Covid-19 include fever, dry cough, tiredness, shortage of breath etc. We would need to ascertain if the data collected accurately mentions this data and take care of any duplication, formatting issues, missing, invalid or outlier values. An example of this would be to convert most of the columns (parameters to be used) into binary format, where presence or absence of fever would be noted as 1 or 0 respectively.\n",
    "In this step, based on the country, data gathered and policy guidelines (domain knowledge), we would need to assign weightage to different parameters. For example, in a country where domestic spread of the disease has not happened yet, Covid-19 assumption and further decisions based on such would only be considered if the patient had prior contact with a known case, and vice-versa._\n",
    "\n",
    "_5. Modeling and Evaluation -\n",
    "The decision tree is then evaluated based on its performance on a test set of data randomly selected from the entire database (in-sample forecast). If it is found viable, then out-of-sample forecast would offer real time analysis of this model. Based on feedback, the model parameters can be tuned for better results._"
